# Data-Mining---Given-two-brain-regions-such-as-Pre-Frontal-Cortex-and-Posterior-Parietal-Cortex-
The problem is to find anatomical relations of these two regions from the articles of the corpus in semantic scholar using its available api s:

Tools & Libraries:

Requests - a library to send HTTP requests:
 We can download pages using the Python requests library. The requests library will make a GET request to a web server, which will download the HTML contents of a given web page for us. 

lxml - provides python bindings to a fast html and xml processing library called libxml. 
BeautifulSoup - a parsing library that uses different parsers to extract data from HTML and XML documents.
 It has the ability to navigate a parsed document and extract what is required.

Requirements:
System: Unix or Windows-based machine
Python 3
BeautifulSoup4 Library

Two Regions of Brain taken for Anatomical Relation:

1.The prefrontal cortex(PFC) is a part of the brain located at the front of the frontal lobe.
It is implicated in a variety of complex behaviors, including planning, and greatly contributes to personality development.

2.The posterior parietal cortex plays an important role in planned movements, spatial reasoning, and attention.
